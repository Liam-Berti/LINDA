I.e.:  \r\n`source('/data/myfolder/stroke/LINDA/linda_predict.R')`  \r\nA file dialog will allow you to select the T1 nifti file of the patient with left hemispheric brain damage.  \r\nLINDA will run and you will see the timestamp of the various steps.  \r\nResults will be saved in a folder named \"linda\" in the same path where the T1 is located.  \r\n  \r\n Note, LINDA will stop if you don't have `ANTsR` installed, and will automatically install the `randomForest` package.  \r\n  \r\n*****  \r\n## Example  \r\n`source('/data/myfolder/stroke/LINDA/linda_predict.R')`  \r\n>  10:42 Loading template...  \r\n10:42 Creating folder: /data/jag/myhome/LINDAtest/linda  \r\n10:42 Loading file: SybjectT1.nii  \r\n10:42 Skull stripping...
