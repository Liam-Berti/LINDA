They provide only the files of the main repository, without the large files containing the trained prediction models. The above link points to a full release that contains also the prediction models._  \r\n  \r\n*****  \r\n## Run:  \r\nOpen R and source the file linda_predict.R\r\n`source('/data/myfolder/stroke/LINDA/linda_predict.R')`  \r\nA file dialog will allow you to select the T1 nifti file of the patient with left hemispheric brain damage.  \r\nLINDA will run and you will see the timestamp of the various steps.  \r\nResults will be saved in a folder named \"linda\" in the same path where the T1 is located.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n _Note, LINDA will stop if you don't have `ANTsR` installed, and will automatically install the `randomForest` package._  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n**Available prediction models:**  \r\n_Currently a model trained on 60 patients from Penn is used. The model works at a maximum resolution of 2mm and contains three hierarchical steps (6mm, 4mm, 2mm). Other models might be available in the future._  \r\n  \r\n*****  \r\n## Example:  \r\n`source('/data/myfolder/stroke/LINDA/linda_predict.R')`  \r\n>  12:09 Loading file: TMT_MPRAGE.nii  \r\n12:09 Creating folder: /data/jag/dp/LINDAtest/TMT/linda  \r\n12:09 Loading template...  \r\n12:09 Skull stripping...
