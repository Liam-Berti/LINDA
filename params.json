{"name":"Linda","tagline":"Lesion Identification with Neighborhood Data Analysis","body":"## What is LINDA?  \r\nIs a toolkit for automatic segmentation of lesions in __chronic__ stroke patients.   \r\n*****  \r\n##  Requirements:  \r\n* Linux or Mac (ANTsR cannot run in Windows yet)  \r\n* [R v3.0 or above](http://www.r-project.org/) \r\n* The [ANTsR](http://stnava.github.io/ANTsR/) package installed in R\r\n* A T1-weighted MRI of a patient with (left hemispheric) stroke\r\n \r\n*****  \r\n## Install:  \r\nDownload the [latest release](https://github.com/dorianps/LINDA/releases/download/0.1/LINDA_v0.1.zip) (v0.1) and unzip in a local folder.  \r\n  \r\n_IMPORTANT: Use the above link for downloading. The Github download does not contain the large files with trained prediction models._  \r\n  \r\n*****  \r\n## Run:  \r\nOpen R and source the file linda_predict.R\r\n`source('/data/myfolder/stroke/LINDA/linda_predict.R')`  \r\nA file dialog will allow you to select the T1 nifti file of the patient with left hemispheric brain damage.  \r\nLINDA will run and you will see the timestamp of the various steps.  \r\nResults will be saved in a folder named \"linda\" in the same path where the T1 is located.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n _Note, LINDA will stop if you don't have `ANTsR` installed, and will automatically install the `randomForest` package._  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n**Available prediction models:**  \r\n_Currently a model trained on 60 patients from Penn is used. The internal prediction engine works with 2mm voxel resolution. This does not mean your images need to be 2mm, any resolution should work._  \r\n  \r\n*****  \r\n## Example:  \r\n`source('/data/myfolder/stroke/LINDA/linda_predict.R')`  \r\n>  12:09 Loading file: TMT_MPRAGE.nii  \r\n12:09 Creating folder: /data/jag/dp/LINDAtest/TMT/linda  \r\n12:09 Loading template...  \r\n12:09 Skull stripping...

Check individual results from our  [60 patients Penn dataset](https://github.com/dorianps/LINDA/blob/master/Individual_Predictions_UPenn_Dataset.pdf) and [45 patients Georgetown dataset](https://github.com/dorianps/LINDA/blob/master/Individual_Predictions_Georgetown_Dataset.pdf).  \r\n  \r\n*****  \r\n## Support:  \r\nThe best way to keep track of bugs or failures is to open a [New Issue](https://github.com/dorianps/LINDA/issues) on the Github system. You can also contact the author via email: dorian dot pustina at uphs dot upenn dot edu (translate from english). If the algorithm proceeds without errors but the automatic segmentation is erroneous, please send (i) your T1 image and (ii) the segmentation produced by LINDA in native space. Try also overlaying `Mask.lesion*.nii.gz` files on the T1 to check whether the brain mask is wrong somewhere.  \r\n  \r\n## Frequently Asked Questions\r\n__- What file formats are accepted__?  \r\nNifti images (.nii and .nii.gz) are accepted. The platform can read many other formats, but we have limited the script to Nifti to avoid confusion with some formats, such as Analyze, in knowing the left-right orientation.  \r\n__- Can I use it with right hemispheric lesions?__  \r\nYes, but you need to flip the L-R orientation before. After that, the prediction will work just as well. We plan to extend the script in the future for use in both left and right lesions.  \r\n__- Can I use this for acute and subacute stroke lesions?__  \r\nNo, the current model is trained only on chronic stroke patients. It might be possible to segment acute stroke with models trained on acute data (let us know if you want to contribute with those data).  \r\n__- Can I use other images: FLAIR, T2, DWI?__  \r\nThe existing model uses only a T1, but we can adapt it with additional T2, FLAIR, DWI. We are open to collaborations with groups that have multimodal data and want to train LINDA with those. Having ~30 subjects is a good start.   \r\n  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
