# LINDA
Lesion Identification with Neighborhood Data Analysis  
*****  
##  Requirements:  
* Linux or Mac (ANTsR cannot run in Windows yet)  
* [R](http://www.r-project.org/) or, even better, [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) 
* The [ANTsR](http://stnava.github.io/ANTsR/) package installed in R
* A T1-weighted MRI of a patient with (left hemispheric) stroke
 
*****  
## Install:  
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/dorianps/LINDA/releases/download/0.1/LINDA_v0.1.zip) and unzip in a local folder.  
  
_IMPORTANT: Do not use the Github download buttons. They provide only the files of the main repository, without the large files containing the trained prediction models. The above link points to a full release that contains also the prediction models._  
  
*****  
## Run:  
Open R and source the file linda_predict.R. I.e.:  
`source('/data/myfolder/stroke/LINDA/linda_predict.R')`  
A file dialog will allow you to select the T1 nifti file of the patient with left hemispheric brain damage.  
LINDA will run and you will see the timestamp of the various steps.  
Results will be saved in a folder named "linda" in the same path where the T1 is located.  
  
 _Note, LINDA will stop if you don't have `ANTsR` installed, and will automatically install the `randomForest` package._
