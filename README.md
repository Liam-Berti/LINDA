Download all the repository and unzip the folder in your local computer.

Open R and source linda_predict.R.

A file dialog will appear on the screen, select the T1 nifti file of the patient with left hemispheric brain damage.
LINDA will run and the results will be found in a folder named "linda" in the same path where the T1 is located.
